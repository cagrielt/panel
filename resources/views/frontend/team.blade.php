              Dr. Yunus Akkoc holds a bachelor’s degree from İstanbul Kültür University. He received his Ph.D. degree of Molecular Biology, Genetics and Bioengineering from Sabancı University, under the supervision of Dr. Devrim Gozuacik. His doctoral studies were focused on deciphering abnormalities of the autophagic machinery in cancers through investigating autophagy-regulating miRNAs and tumor microenvironment. Dr. Akkoc continues his postdoctoral studies to identify autophagy-associated novel pathways in cancer metastasis and dormancy. In addition to his scientific work, Dr. Akkoç is closely interested in culinary arts, Turkish classical music (TSM) and deciphering poems from different cultures.

              Koç Üniversitesi Hastanesi Çocuk Sağlığı ve Hastalıkları Anabilim Dalı’nda 3 senedir asistan hekim olarak görev almaktayım. Pediyatrik beyin tümörleri hakkında olan asistanlık tezim için tanıştığım Devrim Gözüaçık ekibi ile 1,5 senedir birlikte aktif olarak çalışıyorum. Yine Koç Üniversitesi bünyesinde eş zamanlı olarak İmmunoloji Yüksek Lisans programında eğitim görüyorum.
Asitanlık eğitimim boyunca pediyatrik gastroenteroloji ve kardiyoloji bölümleri ile birlikte çalışarak 2 uluslarası yayında yer aldım, yenidoğan yoğun bakımı ile yaptığım çalışma sonuçlarını ise ulusal neonatoloji derneğinin kongresinde paylaştık. Ayrıca uluslararası Avrupa Pediatrik ve Konjenital Kardiyoloji Kongresi’ne 3 sözlü sunum ve 1 poster sunum kabulü ile katılım hakkı kazandım. 
Tıp Fakültesi eğitimimi 2012-2018 yılları arasında İstanbul Üniversitesi Cerrahpaşa Tıp Fakültesi’nde tamamladım. Tıp eğitimim sürecinde İmperial College’da yoğun bakım ekibi ile yaptığım bir poster sunumu gerçekleştirip, Frankfurt Höchst Üniversitesi Kardiyoloji Bölümü, Massachusetts General Hospital Girişimsel Radyoloji Bölümü ve Stanford Üniversitesi Nöroloji Bölümünde 3 ayrı staj programı tamamlayıp Berlin Charite Üniversitesi’nde Erasmus programı dahilinde 6 ay geçirdim. 2012 senesinde İstanbul Erkek Lisesi’den Abitur Diplom ile mezun oldum. 
Gelecekte pediyatrik onkoloji alanında uzmanlaşmayı hedefliyorum ve Prof. Dr. Devrim Gözüaçık ve ekibi sayesinde onkolojik araştırmalar konusunda eğitim alma ve tecrübe kazanma şansı edindim. Şu an aktif olarak yürütülen projelere asistanlık eğitim süreci boyunca dahil olmayı planlıyorum.
